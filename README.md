### Installation Guide

1) Clone this repo

2) To test locally first, `cd` into the folder, run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate` and `bundle exec figaro install`

3) [Add Incoming WebHooks](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks) as your Slack integrations

5) Put it inside `config/application.yml` file. If you need a template for `application.yml` file, copy from [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b3c37667f62635dc7156903e479f7bfa)

6) After that, put your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key inside `config/application.yml` file

7) The best practice is to create a user and add SQS policy to that user

9) From your local machine terminal, run `heroku ps:scale web=1 worker=1` and `heroku run rake db:migrate`

10) That's it. You're done!

### Important: AWS SQS Setup

Please make sure you create 2 queues inside SQS. One is the main queue and one is for the dead/failed queue.

Put `3` inside `Maximum Receives`. This means that, if Shoryuken failed to perform the job for 3 times (ie: record not found), the job will be moved from main queue to dead queue.

### Issue: Push Rejected?

Easy. Just add these variables inside your Heroku App Settings > Config Variables and push again.
